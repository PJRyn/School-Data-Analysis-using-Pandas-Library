School Data Analysis using Pandas Library
## About the Project
This project utilized python notebooks and the pandas library to provide analysis on two .csv files "schools_complete.csv" and "students_complete.csv". This was a way to practice multiple analysis techniques on a large joint dataset. The analysis is broken down into multiple sections which are as follows:


- Local Government Area Summary
   - which sought to breakdown and calculate multiple key metrics:
       * total number of schools
       * total number of students
       * total budget
       * average math score
       * average reading score
       * percentage of students with a passing maths score (50 or greater)
       * percentage of students with a passing reading score (50 or greater)
       * percentage of students who passed maths **and** reading (% Overall Passing)
       * Create a dataframe to hold the above results


- A Summary of School Data
   -A summary of key metrics of each school:
       * School Name
       * School Type
       * Total Students
       * Total School Budget
       * Per Student Budget
       * Average Math Score
       * Average Reading Score
       * % Passing Math
       * % Passing Reading
       * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)


- Highest Performing Schools (by Percentage of Overall Passing)


- Lowest Performing Schools (by Percentage of Overall Passing)


- Math Scores by Each Year Level


- Reading Scores by Each Year Level


- Testing Scores by School Size


- Testing Scores by School Type


The files used for analysis are located within the 'Resources' folder. The 'PyCitySchools.ipynb' provides an analysis of each listed section and can be seen in browser or within a compatible IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook.
